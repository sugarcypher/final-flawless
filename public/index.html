  <h2>FLAWLESS FINISH CERAMIC COATING</h2>
  <h3>The "WHY", The "WHAT", The "HOW" $$</h3>

  <h4>The "WHY": Why does my car need this?</h4>
  <p>Investing in ceramic coating is a smart move, especially in the harsh desert climate of Palm Springs. The intense sun, high temperatures, and blowing sand can quickly degrade your car's paint. Ceramic coating acts as a durable, transparent shield that protects against UV rays, oxidation, and fading. It also repels dust, sand, bird droppings, and waterâ€”making your car easier to clean and maintain. Unlike wax, which breaks down quickly in extreme heat, ceramic coating lasts for years, offering long-term protection and preserving your vehicle's value. It's a cost-effective way to keep your car looking new.</p>

  <h4>The "WHAT": What is being done to my car?</h4>
  <p>Before applying a ceramic coating, thorough preparation is essential to ensure the coating bonds properly and delivers long-lasting protection. The process begins with an initial inspection to assess the condition of the paint, identifying any scratches, swirl marks, oxidation, or contamination that need attention (this is a walk-around that will be done with Jason and vehicle owner.) Next, a pre-wash and thorough decontamination wash are performed using pH-neutral shampoo and iron removers to strip away old waxes, sealants, and embedded contaminants. A clay bar is then used to remove any remaining bonded debris, leaving the surface smooth. After drying the vehicle, paint correction is performed as needed. This includes high-speed buffing/compounding to eliminate deeper imperfections and polishing to enhance gloss and remove swirl marks. A final inspection under bright lighting ensures uniform correction, and the surface is then wiped with an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution to remove any remaining oils or residues. At this point, the vehicle is ready for ceramic coating application, with a clean, defect-free surface to ensure optimal adhesion and durability. The ceramic coating is applied one panel at a time. Once the coating is FULLY cured (7 days) you will really only need water to rinse it off and dry!! The coating is rated to last 3 to 5 years. Closer to 3 years if not garage kept, closer to 5 years if covered/garaged.</p>
